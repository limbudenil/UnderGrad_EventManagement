&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How many venues would you look at before making a selection for an event? 5? 10? As a leading UK and international venue finding agency, FARADE Event Management can conduct a venue search from over 15,000 venues.

Venues Event Management has operated as a venue finding agency since we began trading in 1989. Over that time we have developed strong relationships with all the major hotel and conference centre groups as well as independent properties.

The £50 million we put through the industry coupled with our excellent negotiation skills will also save you money. Perhaps our most invaluable benefit to clients is knowledge.
